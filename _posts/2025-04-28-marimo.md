[marimo](https://marimo.io/) is a reactive Python notebook that runs in the browser via WebAssembly. You can embed interactive marimo notebooks directly in your blog posts — readers can run and edit Python code without installing anything.

al-folio supports two ways to embed marimo notebooks:

1. **Inline snippets** — write Python code directly in your post that becomes interactive
2. **Iframe embeds** — embed hosted marimo notebooks from [marimo.app](https://marimo.app)

## Inline marimo snippets

The simplest approach is to write Python code blocks directly in your post. When `marimo: true` is set in the frontmatter, the `marimo-snippets` library is loaded automatically and converts your code blocks into interactive notebooks running via WebAssembly.

Wrap your code in a `<div><marimo-iframe>` block with fenced code blocks inside. Each code block becomes a separate cell in the notebook:

<div>
<marimo-iframe>

```python
import marimo as mo
```

```python
name = mo.ui.text(placeholder="your name", label="Enter your name:")
name
```

```python
mo.md(f"Hello, **{name.value or 'stranger'}**! 👋") if name.value else mo.md("Type your name above!")
```

</marimo-iframe>
</div>

The code above creates a reactive text input — type your name and see the greeting update in real time! This is powered entirely by WebAssembly running in your browser, with no server needed.

### Merging code blocks with markdown cells

You can also include markdown cells alongside Python cells:

<div>
<marimo-iframe data-height="600px">

```md
# Introduction

You can also add markdown cells to your notebooks.
```

```python
import marimo as mo
```

```python
slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 10)
slider
```

```python
slider.value * "🍃"
```

</marimo-iframe>
</div>

## Iframe embeds

For more complex notebooks, you can host them on [marimo.app](https://marimo.app) and embed them via iframe using the `marimo.liquid` include:

{% raw %}

```liquid
{% include marimo.liquid src="https://marimo.app/l/YOUR_NOTEBOOK_ID" %}
```

{% endraw %}

Here is a hosted notebook from the marimo team:

{% include marimo.liquid src="https://marimo.app/l/c7h6pz" height="400px" mode="read" caption="A hosted marimo notebook" %}

You can also customize the embed:

{% raw %}

```liquid
{% include marimo.liquid src="https://marimo.app/l/YOUR_NOTEBOOK_ID" height="800px" mode="edit" caption="My interactive notebook" %}
```

{% endraw %}

### Include parameters

| Parameter | Default   | Description                                      |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `src`     | —         | URL of the hosted marimo notebook **(required)** |
| `height`  | `"600px"` | Height of the iframe                             |
| `width`   | `"100%"`  | Width of the iframe                              |
| `mode`    | `"read"`  | `"read"` (read-only) or `"edit"` (editable)      |
| `embed`   | `true`    | Append `embed=true` query parameter              |
| `caption` | —         | Caption text displayed below the notebook        |
| `title`   | —         | Accessible title for the iframe                  |
| `class`   | —         | Additional CSS classes                           |

## Setting up your own post

To add marimo notebooks to your blog post:

1. Add `marimo: true` to your post's frontmatter — this loads the `marimo-snippets` library
2. For inline snippets, wrap Python code blocks in `<marimo-iframe>` tags
3. For iframe embeds, use `{% raw %}{% include marimo.liquid src="..." %}{% endraw %}`

That's it! Your readers get a fully interactive Python environment right in their browser.
